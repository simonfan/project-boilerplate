This project boilerplate was built in order to support unit testing for each module created.
It provides a structure for client-side single page app projects.

KEEP IN MIND: this directory structure was not made for server side node.js projects. You can freely modify where the client-side project main dir is. All code inside this folder will work. This is very important, as you can separate your client-side work from your server-side work.

Also, within each test dir, it is possible to set up a demo page. 

Everything is done via RequireJS AMD modules.
